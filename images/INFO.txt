images with the suffix SSP are the active subspace "sufficient summary plots".

The inflow AS analysis produced images based on exit pressure (as opposed to max(P)), using the key "EP" in the title.

FFR is the "fuel flow rate" which was the fuel plenum pressure applied when trying to have an equivalence ratio "ER" of a specific value [0.25,0.3,0.35,0.4] under nominal conditions.

The images with "ER" show the computed equivalence ratio plotted against the active variable (AS best dimension). Interestingly, if we believe the active variable to be a good proxy for thrust, we see there is little correlation to the achieved equivalence ratio.
